The code base is created to create Fast API end points to faciliate interviewer interviewee interactions.
The fastapi app is hosted on **AWS EC2 instance** http://51.20.129.124/docs 

There are two end points created

* POST: post_graph_invoke
    * The end point invokes a langgraph based graph which is responsible to evaluate interviewee response, store the questions, answers, evaluation in db and generate new question for the interviewee.
* GET: get_evaluation
    * The enpoint calls myslq db on **AWS RDS** and fetches questions, evaluations and marks for a given user_id
